Crucial Updates
==================================================================
Traider.IO can be a helpful foundation to a completely custom MEAN stack eCommerce solution.

We updated to the latest stable error-free package by addressing the following:
- Accessing the proper BSON web_builder path
- bypassing BSONPure when accessing ObjectID in MongoDB Connection
- Ensuring DB Connection before starting Server

traider.io
==================================================================
traider.io is a new open source ecommerce plaform. Although technically it's led by Eastpoint Software, it's intended to be a fully engaged community project, and we're greatly welcoming contributions from the development community.

Getting started
==================================================================

To get started, you'll need to:

1. Fork a copy of the repository to your own github account
2. Edit for copy online or clone it to your local copy using git (TODO: add more info)
3. Ensure you have nodejs installed locally
4. Ensure you have mongodb installed & running locally (default config expects no authentication on mongo)
5. Resolve the dependancies on other modules by navigating to the root folder of the project in your terminal window and running "npm install" (no quotes).
5. Start the application using the command "node traider.js", also in the app root folder.
6. Open http://localhost:5000/api/products/seed to create some dummy product data
7. Browse to http://localhost:5000/
